# ocr_using_raspberrypi
This project combines open source software and machine learning in a Raspberry Pi ecosystem.Here, Open-CV, a powerful tool for real-time computer vision and image processing challenges, is one of the open-source programmes utilised. With the Raspberry Pi and facial recognition being the first excursion into the Open-CV scene, this will be the second. We'll also make use of the Coco Library's trained collection of things and creatures. A sizable object identification, segmentation, and captioning collection is the Coco (Common Object in Context) Library. The Raspberry Pi will be able to identify many objects and animals by using this training library. There are pre-trained libraries for a wide variety of things, beings, sounds, and animals, so if this specific library here does not suit your needs you can find many others freely accessible online. The library used here will enable our Raspberry Pi will be able to identify 91 unique objects/animals and provide a constantly updating confidence rating.
